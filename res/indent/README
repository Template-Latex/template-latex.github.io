USAGE
    You'll need

        latexindent.pl
        LatexIndent/*.pm
        defaultSettings.yaml

    in the same directory. Windows users might prefer to grab latexindent.exe

* IMPORTANT *

This script may not work for your style of formatting; I highly 
recommend comparing the outputfile.tex to make sure that 
nothing has been changed (or removed) in a way that will damage
your file.

I recommend both using the following:
    - a visual check, at the very least, make sure that 
      each file has the same number of lines
    - a check using latexdiff inputfile.tex outputfile.tex
    - git status myfile.tex
